Directions: A login screen is displayed which accepts the credentials presented in the MySQL database. Upon clicking the sign-in button, the user
can click to either enter the customer, appointment, or report homepage. The customer and appointment homepage allow to create, read, update and delete
information. The report homepage allows to view the specified reports as requested.

Addition Report Description: The additional report I decided to create was to display a table of the different first-level divisions of each customer in the
database, and to tally the amount of times those first-level divisions have appeared in the database.
